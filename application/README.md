# UI

React project using NPM, Webpack and Babel, use them just because i'm used to.

## Packages
 1. **react-bootstrap:** I choose to use a base with some basic components for layout and styles since it is how I usually work. Never used before but since it was based on Bootstrap I figure I would not have much issues.
 2. **react-minimal-pie-chart:** I looked for one package to do the Pie Chart, I did not liked this one at all, but I do not wanted to waste much time on this part, for the most part I think the important thing here was how the data for the chart was built.
 3. **react 18.1:** Just because it was the latest, I did not used it before so i'm sure I did not used anything from this version that is not on **16**


## TODOs

 1. **Unit testing:** Sadly I don't have experience doing unit test un React applications, just never done them on the job. I would try to add something over the week using jest that is the package that I used for knockout a long time ago.
 2. **Refactor:** The Dashboard can be refactored a little by making a component to render those 2 cards, which are almost the same. Same thing for the Operations component and the with a component that handles the buy/sell actions.
