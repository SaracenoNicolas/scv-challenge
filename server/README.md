# Server

A server using express

## Data
I do not put a database so this doesn't persist anywhere, I did put 2 objects for working with the UI, this are modeled mostly on how I expected the API to answer but the idea I have is that there should be an Investment Table and a User Table and the BE queries this databases when need it.

## Document the API
I'll try to do this Monday/tuesday.
